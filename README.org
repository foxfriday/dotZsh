* .zshrc

Configuration for the Z shell (zsh). It requires three plugins:

 - zsh-autosuggestions
 - zsh-history-substring-search
 - zsh-syntax-highlighting

It adds a minimal prompt, which doesn't do or tell you much, thought it look like the pure prompt. It also has a day and a night theme which can be toggled with ~toggletheme~. The themes are based on the base16 tomorrow themes. Bindings try to approach those used in vim with some limited success. It also works OK with pyenv and inside Emacs with vterm. I also use ~sdvc~ to look up words. Because I usually forget the command, it is aliased to dict.
